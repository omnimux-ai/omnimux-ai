/**
 * Renderer-side first-level page tracker.
 *
 * The hub publishes `window.__omnimuxStage` (with `PRODUCT_STAGE_EVENT`) so any
 * plugin can read the currently claimed first-level page without importing hub
 * internals or copying another plugin's DOM — that public global is the only
 * seam used here.
 *
 * Scope: this reports pages that claim the hub's **product stage**. First-level
 * pages that live as workbench Tabs (assets / products / accounts / inspiration
 * / publish / analytics) are contractually forbidden from claiming a stage, so
 * they are NOT counted — see the README's data-scope note.
 *
 * The tracker never talks to the analytics service directly: it posts small
 * page events to the Host ingest route, which owns the site configuration and
 * forwards through the same queue as tool-call events.
