 *
 * Override per request with `deadlineMs`; never read an environment variable —
 * `omnimux tokens exec` and the Settings seat are the hub's configuration
 * surfaces, and a deadline is an implementation detail of the caller.
 *
 * The window is only re-checked between polls, and `DEFAULT_RETRY_BUDGET_MS`
 * bounds a poll's backoff waits rather than its in-flight request, so a run can
 * overshoot the deadline by at most one `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (10s):

 * workflow applies to one execution, whereas `DEFAULT_TASK_DEADLINE_MS` bounds
 * **one task's poll window**. They are not two views of one thing.
 *
 * Comparing them still has a use, but only a narrow one, and the granularity
 * has to be stated with it: a *single-node* run cannot have its task-level
 * `omnimux-task-timeout` masked, because 20 minutes of polling ends before the
 * 30-minute run budget does. That is the whole guarantee.
 *
 * It does **not** generalize to multi-node graphs. The run budget is shared by
 * every node, so with several nodes — sequential or under `maxParallel` — the
 * 30 minutes can arrive while an individual task is still well inside its own
 * 20-minute window. When it does, the run is terminated first, the task-level
 * error code never appears, and the node fails with the run-level timeout
 * instead. Two consequences follow for a multi-node graph worth naming:
 * upstream work may keep running (and billing) after the local run is gone,
 * and its artifact is discarded rather than collected.
 *
 * Both plugins assert their own side of the comparison (the hub cannot import
 * the workflow's constant across the hub/domain boundary), and each assertion
 * covers only the single-node guarantee above.
