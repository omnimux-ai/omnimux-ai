/**
 * #1382: reading and validating a persisted upstream task reference.
 *
 * The reference lives in `nodeStates[<nodeId>].upstreamTask` and travels through
 * `toJSON` / `fromJSON` / `buildExecutionRecord` / `loadExecutionRecord` with no
 * extra plumbing. What those paths carry is unchecked JSON, so this module is
 * the one place that decides what a *usable* reference is: a missing or
 * malformed field means "no reference", which routes the node back to the
 * pre-#1382 behavior (resubmit) instead of reconciling against garbage.
 *
 * The read/write operations themselves live on `ExecutionContext`, which owns
 * the node-state map and the persistence hook.

 * rather than failing the load, which is why `schemaVersion` stays `1` and no
 * migration step exists.
