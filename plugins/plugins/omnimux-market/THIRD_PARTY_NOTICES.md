## BGGG Amazon Data

The bundled `catalog/skills/bggg-data-amazon/` package is derived from
https://github.com/binggandata/bggg-skills/tree/1034ee5805f3fd5b010a4f57affa4aa796ab75d5/bggg-data-amazon.
Its complete root MIT notice (Copyright (c) 2026 BGGG) is retained in that
package's `LICENSE`; the upstream scraper MIT notice is retained in
`references/upstream_LICENSE`. Both files travel with the installed directory.
`PROVENANCE.md` records the pinned source and the SKILL.md runtime/path adaptation.
The MIT grants cover software, not rights to collected customer reviews.

## 上游同步策略

上游迭代活跃，本 fork 的改动保持「追加式」以降低同步成本。同步上游修复时：
`git diff` 对比基线与本目录的标识符清单（插件 id、路由 `/omnimux-market`、配置文件
`omnimux-market.json`、CSS id、locale key、sidebar action id），手工移植目标修复。
