# A+ Modules Prompt Template

All 7 A+ Brand Content modules live in this file. Each section below contains the template for one module. Read the section matching the module you're generating.

**Critical reminder:** Every A+ image must use the MAIN IMAGE as reference in the `image_urls` array (`image_urls=["main:final"]`) for product consistency. All 7 A+ modules are typography- and graphic-heavy, so generate them with `model="gpt-image-2.5-sunburst"`.

**Ratios and resolution by module:**
- Module 1 (Hero Banner): `aspect_ratio="21:9"`, `resolution="2K"`
- Modules 2–6: `aspect_ratio="3:2"`, `resolution="2K"`
- Module 7 (Brand Endorsement): `aspect_ratio="21:9"`, `resolution="2K"`

## Tool call pattern for A+ modules

All 7 A+ modules are generated with `model="gpt-image-2.5-sunburst"` (they are typography- and graphic-heavy), each referencing the main image via `image_urls=["main:final"]` for product consistency. Each `generate_image` call returns its result directly — no job submission, no polling.

For **21:9 modules** (Module 1 and 7):

```
generate_image(
  prompt="[FILLED_PROMPT]",
  output_asset_id="aplus:<module-name>",
  aspect_ratio="21:9",
  resolution="2K",
  model="gpt-image-2.5-sunburst",
  image_urls=["main:final"]
)
# → returns the result directly with the given output_asset_id
```

For **3:2 modules** (Modules 2–6):

```
generate_image(
  prompt="[FILLED_PROMPT]",
  output_asset_id="aplus:<module-name>",
  aspect_ratio="3:2",
  resolution="2K",
  model="gpt-image-2.5-sunburst",
  image_urls=["main:final"]
)
# → returns the result directly with the given output_asset_id
```

The result lands at the `output_asset_id` you set. Use `get_asset` / `list_assets` only if you need to inspect the result asset inline.

## Key reminders

- **Text size is critical** in A+ — Amazon compresses images aggressively. Always >30pt, preferably larger for headlines.
- **Narrative flow matters** — the 7 modules should read in order like a story (identity → empathy → solution → credibility → proof → simplicity → trust).
- **Consistent visual identity** — same palette, typography, icon style, product appearance across all 7 modules.
- **Product reference is mandatory** — every generation references the main image asset `main:final` in `image_urls`.
- **If the user hasn't provided content** for selling points, ingredients, steps, etc. — ask before generating. Don't fabricate claims.
